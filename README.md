# **Liri Bot**

## **What is it?**
‘Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface’ is just like Siri; the only difference between both is that Liri uses written commands, instead of having to speak (for those who are too lazy to use their vocal cords…).

## **Commands:**
1. **concert-this ‘<artist/band name here>’**: this command will display the next available concert information (name of venue, location, date) from the artist/band.

2. **spotify-this-song `<song /name here>’**: this command will show the track information (artist(s), name, preview, album). You can leave the song blank to receive a suggestion from the app :)!

3. **movie-this ‘<movie name here>’**: this command will output the movie information (title, release year, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating, production country, language, plot, actors). Leaving the movie blank will suggest a reeeeaaaallyyyy good movie (and it’s on Netflix!).

4. **do-what-it-says**: depending on the content of the random.txt file, which holds a command with its specified option, the chosen command will run.


Note: This app uses the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. Also, some screenshots were added to show typical user flows through the app, just a little help in case you don’t get how it works.

**Hope you like it!**
